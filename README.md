# huffman
Implementation of Huffman Coding Algorithm for WCET analysis


## max length of strings
testdata.h:24:1: warning: string length ‘4096’ is greater than the length ‘4095’ ISO C99 compilers are required to support [-Woverlength-strings]

-> hence we have chosen to limit the length of the input string to 4096 characters.
